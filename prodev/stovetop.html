<h1>Cooking Up Opportunities</h1> 

<div>
<p>Identifying and creating opportunities for your career is a lot like cooking. An experienced cook knows they need to focus on a just handful of orders in order to successfully cook up satisfying results. 

<p>By bring this same type of focus to your career initiatives, we will use the analogy of a kitchen stove top to identify the four initiatives you will cook up for your career during or immediately after your training program.</p>

<div>
<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>Draw a cook top. Generally, gas ranges look like a rectangular box with four circle burners inside it. The front burners are larger because they require more attention and can create more heat. You need to focus your attention on your front burners or else things will get burnt and go to waste. The back burners do not require as much focus or direct attention. Yet, cooks know that they need these burners on a consistent low heat to simmer the dish. They occasionally check in and stir the pot to keep it going. </p>

<p>Next, write in the four initiatives that you are working on in the appropriate circle. Only write a few words to describe the objective. For example, in the picture below, “Salesforce Admin Cert” means to do the work necessary to successfully pass the Salesforce Admin Certification exam. You do not need to list out all the steps rather just the title of goal you are trying to achieve. </p>

<h3>Extra Credit</h3> 
<p>Now that you have your four initiatives, consider reverse engineering the goal and write down all the steps you think are needed to complete the goal. For example, the Salesforce Admin Cert list might look like.</p>

<ul>
<li>Study the appropriate Trailmix</li>
<li>Get at least 50 badges on the Trailhead including Business Admin Super Badge</li>
<li>Organize weekly study group with others preparing for the exam</li>
<li>Get money to pay and register for exam</li>
<li>Take the Exam</li>
<li>Pass it then update resume/LinkedIn with the cert</li>
<li>Inform colleagues that I have this skills set now</li>
</ul>
