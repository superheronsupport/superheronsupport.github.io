	<h1>Program Orientation for Professional Development</h1>
	<h2>What is your Career Plan?</h2>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>The majority of your bootcamp will be devoted to working on "hard" skills such as learning how to code and designing prototypes. The professional and personal development portion of your program will be quite different. It
		will be a deep dive into building confidence and understanding on who you are as a professional in the tech industry. Our professional development or "Pro Dev" for short will be a little
		different than traditional career counseling as taught in colleges and universities. You will identify what your career outcome goals are and how you are going
		to achieve them. In the local tech industry, "soft" or "people" skills are highly valued. Many employers we consult with are hiring for "aptitude
		and attitude" more than raw technical skills. These soft skills are fundamental to your success. They will require a lot of introspection
		and willingness to get out of your comfort zone for certain activities such as public speaking, networking, and team building.
		The pace and structure of professional development curriculum will be very different than the main curriculum taught in your program. There are difference between each program due to the nature of the technology stack and local industry. In this immersive training environment, please remember to be agile, prioritize collaboration,
		iterate to success, and always take time to reflect on what you are learning from the entire experience. It will support you greatly come interview time. - Dan Heron</p>

	<h3>Build Your Career Team</h3>
	<p>It is important that you have a supporting team on your side during and after your program. Here are couple people you can consider as resources at the start of career exploration. It is up to you to establish the rest of your team.</p>

	<h2>Types of Activities</h2>
	<p>First make sure you are on the Slack channel for Professional Development #pro-dev-lab. This channel is for current participants of various cohorts to share resources and ask questions.</p>
	<h3>Core Modules</h3>
	<p>Full-time programs include core professional development modules that will be conducted during the work week. Please see your instructor on times and locations.
	</p>
	<h3>Lab (aka Pro Dev Lab)</h3>
	<p>Every Week (generally on Friday afternoons) is lab time for all participants. Lab time can range from 1-3 hours depending on the activities that week. Some examples of activities are workshops,
		guest speakers, presentations, pitch practice, team building exercises, employer interviews, "Back to Basic" programming
		and other industry related events. Weekly schedule will be posted in Slack.</p>
		<h3>Tech Talks (aka Ted Talks)</h3>
		<p>Weekly evening talks from instructors and other senior developers on various technology and programming.</p>
		<h3>Group Workout (aka Recess)</h3>
		<p>Full-time participants are required to take part in group physical workout exercises. They are meant as team building activities for your cohort rather than getting shredded. Wellness is important in workforce.</p>
	<h3>Community Wide Events</h3>
	<p>In addition to program specific activities, there will be occasional events open to all current Deep Dive participants. 
		They may include a visit to a local employer, business networking event, Demo Day Mixer, alumni workshops, etc. You will be informed
		via Slack about these as they are coming up. </p>

	<h2>Deliverables (Full-time Participants)</h2>
	<p>Participation in professional development acitivies is crucial to you and your cohort's success. They make up a portion of your grade and reflect our capacity
		to support you during and after the bootcamp. If you do well in professional development, more than likey you will do well in the tech industry.</p>
	<h4>These are the deliverable items you need to do in order to pass this portion of the bootcamp:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Career Portfolio (aka Pro Dev Doc)</strong> - This is a digital portfolio of your homework assignments and reflections. It also a great platform to upload and link your assets such as social media profiles, resumes, etc. Each program has a different type of Portfolio based on the technology and tools they are learning in their studies. For example, in the Web Bootcamp, we are looking for a Web Document (HTML, CSS) to display their learning and process. For the Android bootcamp, we are looking for a simple App (XML). Regardless of the platform, we are looking for a simple set of Views and Markup. If you want to something fancy you are welcome to create that. The most important thing for us is to make it easy to navigate and read.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Resume/Portfolio</strong> - You will be required to create an updated tech resume that can be printed up as PDF on one page. You are welcome to make an online resume if you want in additional to the paper version.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Updated Online Presence</strong> - You will need to research yourself and come up with a strategy for your online presence. Having a complete LinkedIn profile is the minimum acceptable product. If you have concerns about putting yourself out there online, please see your coaches right away.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Coding Repository</strong> - You will need an online and open code repository so Employers can see you that actually code. Please link this on your Pro Dev Doc.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Community Engagement</strong> - We will be observing your initiatives to get out in there such as atteding tech events, interacting with potential employers/clients, getting yourself an internship, etc. If we don't see it or hear about it, we might not know about your drive.</li>
