	<h1>Orientation for Professional Development</h1>
	<h2>What is your Career Plan?</h2>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>The majority of your training program will be devoted to working on "hard" skills such as learning how to code and designing prototypes. The Professional Development portion of your program will be quite different. It
		will be a deep dive into building confidence and understanding on who you are as a tech professional. Professional development ("Pro Dev" for short) is not traditional career counseling as taught in many community colleges and universities. You will be responsible for identifying what your career outcome goals are and how you are going
		to achieve them. </p>
		<p>In the tech industry, "soft" or "people" skills are highly valued. Many employers I consult with are hiring for "aptitude
		and attitude" more than raw technical skills. These soft skills are fundamental to your success. They will require a lot of introspection
		and willingness to get out of your comfort zone for certain activities such as public speaking, networking, and team building activities.
		The pace and structure of the Professional Development curriculum will be very different than the main curriculum taught in your program. </p>
		<p>All full-time programs require participantion in Professional Development. Why? In addition to graduating the program, success to us is when you achieve your career goals. If we don't know what those are then we can't help you get there. Please note: there are differences between the Pro Dev for each program due to the different technology stacks and local industries. In this immersive training environment, please remember to be agile, prioritize collaboration,
		iterate to success, and always take time to reflect on what you are learning from the entire experience. It will support you greatly come interview time. - Dan Heron, Pro Dev Lead

	<h2>Types of Pro Dev Activities</h2>
	<h3>Pro Dev Workshops</h3>
	<p>Full-time programs include a handful of core Professional Development modules that will be conducted during the work week. Please see your instructor on times and locations.
	</p>
	<h3>Lab (aka Pro Dev Lab)</h3>
	<p>Every Week (generally on Friday afternoons) is lab time for all participants. Lab time can range from 1-3 hours depending on the activities that week. Some examples of activities are workshops,
		guest speakers, pitch practice, team building exercises, employer interviews, 
		and other industry related events. Weekly schedule will be posted in Pro Dev channel on Slack.</p>
		<h3>Tech Talks (aka Ted Talks)</h3>
		<p>Generally there once a week there is an evening talk from an instructor or another senior developer on various technology topics.</p>
		<h3>Group Workout (aka Recess)</h3>
		<p>Full-time participants are required to take part in group physical workout exercises together. This is meant as team building activity for your cohort rather than the goal of getting ripped. Physical wellness is important in this fast paced workforce.</p>
	<h3>Community Wide Events (aka Deep Dive Events)</h3>
	<p>In addition to program specific activities, there will be occasional events open to all Deep Dive participants. 
		They may include a visit to a local employer, business networking event, Demo Day Mixer, alumni workshops, Code-A-Thon/Hackathons etc. You will hear about these as they come up. Some will be mandatory others will be optional. </p>
		<h3>Graduation</h3>
	<p>This is final day of the formal program. Where you will present to an audience of family, friends, and employers.</p>

	<h2>Deliverables (Full-time Participants)</h2>
	<p>Participation in professional development acitivies is crucial to you and your cohort's success. They make up a portion of your grade and reflect our capacity
		to support you during and after the bootcamp. If you do well in professional development, more than likey you will do well in the tech industry.</p>
	<h4>These are the deliverable items you need to create in order to pass Professional Development:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Career Portfolio</strong> - This is a digital portfolio of your homework assignments and reflections. It also a great platform to upload and link your assets such as social media profiles, resumes, etc. Each program has a different type of Portfolio based on the technology and tools they are learning in their studies. For example, in the Web Bootcamp, we are looking for a Web Document (HTML, CSS) to display their learning and process. For the Android bootcamp, we are looking for a simple App (XML). Regardless of the platform, we are looking for a simple set of Views and Markup. If you want to something fancy you are welcome to create that. The most important thing for us is to make it easy to navigate and read.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Resume</strong> - You will be required to create an updated tech resume that can be printed up as PDF on one page. You are welcome to make an online resume if you want in additional to the paper version.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Online Presence</strong> - You will need to research yourself and come up with a strategy for your online presence. Having a complete LinkedIn profile is the minimum acceptable product. If you have concerns about putting yourself out there online, please see your coaches right away.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Online Repository</strong> - You will need an online repository so Employers can see you that actually know how to develop/design. Please link this on your Career Portfolio.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Community Engagement</strong> - We will be observing your initiatives to get out in there such as attending tech events, interacting with potential employers/clients, getting yourself an internship, etc. If we don't see it or hear about it, we might not know about your drive.</li>
	</ol>
