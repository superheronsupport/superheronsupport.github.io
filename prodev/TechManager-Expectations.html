<h2>Graduate/Alumni Expectations</h2>
	<p>The professional development after completing your program is quite different than career consulting and professional development during the program. Therefore there are additional expectations from your coaches to help you excel in your career.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Responsibility is on you to schedule meetings, ask questions, get a job or client</li>
	<li>Elevate your questions after you have done initial research and asked a cohort member aka Who Wants to be a Developer! </li>
	<li>Submission of homework assignments are to be on time via email or direct message on Slack. We will not hunt you down for your these. Donâ€™t expect that we will check you repository to see if you did the work.</li>
	<li>Participation in all activities are mandatory. If you need to opt-out of something, please consult with your manager otherwise you will receive negative marks. Schedule is tentative to change or cancellation. </li>
	<li>Emotional Intelligence is a serious skill. Study yourself/be aware of how statements may be interpreted/understood differently. </li>
	<li>Cleanliness is next to godliness. Be sure to keep the space clean and organized.</li>
	<li>Train, you are here to train. We are not here to do the work for you. While we will do all we can to help you achieve your goals, it is ultimately up to you to learn how to learn. </li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Things to consider to increase your Tech Talent</h2>

	<li>Sandbox Stuff vs Core-Work</li>
	<li>You are a libility until you are an asset</li>
	</ul>
