<!-- Reflection on Clean Code -->
<h1>D-Note's Clean Code</h1>

<p>In order to be professional developer, it is the small things that matter. "Attentiveness to detail is an even more critical foundation of professionalism than is any grand vision" - James O. Coplien </p>

<!-- Forward -->
<h2>Forward</h2>
<p>In the 50's the Japanese were the master's productivity through maintenance rather than mass output. A quality approach called "Total Productive Maintenance" taught the a 5 principles (5S philosophy)</p>
<ol>
	<li>Organization | Sorting (Seiri) - Knowing where things are and how you sorted them</li>
	<li>Tidiness | Systematize (Seiton) - Code should be where you expect it to be</li>
	<li>Cleaning | Shrine (Seiso) - Be sure to clean out things that disrupt peace such as future ideas commented out for a later version</li>
	<li>Standardization (Seiketsu) - Create a coding style with your team and set a practice</li>
	<li>Discipline (Shutsuke) - Practice it and reflect on your work</li>
</ol>
<p>These principles are not to be seen as a feel good to read and agree with. They are a challenge to you to refactor your code mercilessly, to show your great power in the execution of details, and to be responsible. Remember the old saying "Leave the campground cleaner that you found it"? The same is true for coding. "Clean Code honors the deep roots of wisdom beneath our broader culture, or our culture as it once was, or should be, and can be with attentiveness to detail" </p>

<strong>Style Distinguish Excellence from mere competence</strong>

<p>A cornerstone of being a professional developer is to care about the quality of the code. "Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care" You are already have so many dependents and things to keep track of as a coder, the last thing you need is messy code. Do yourself a favor and take the time and write clean code.</p>

<strong>Activity</strong>
<p>How does physical environment look? Look around at your workstation? Is it messy? Do you care? How can you manifest clean organized systems, digitally if you don't physically? *Hint* Clean your desk and the environment around you</p>

<!-- Lesson 1 -->
<h2>Lesson 1 - Clean Code</h2>
<p>Can you tell the difference between good code and bad code?</p>
<p>Some programmers argue that machines (IDE for examples) will do all the work for us. This idea is nonsense. There will always be code to write. Code represents the details of the requirements. Those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they have to be specified. They must be specified in a way that a machine can execute them. This process is what we call “programming”. The specification is “code”.
</p>

<p>It is all about identifying and specifying requirements. Vague feelings will not lead to the creation of successful systems. Code is the language in which we ultimately express the requirements. Computer languages, frameworks, and tool are just trying to get closer to the requirements.
</p>

<p><strong>Wading</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever been significantly impeded by bad code? This is called “Wading”. You wade through bad code slowly hoping to find an understanding or a foothold to find a way out. If you don’t write good code the first time, you will never get back to it. Later equals never. We say will go back and clean it up later and course the days go by and we never do. Don’t lie to yourself or your team.
</p>

<p><strong>Slowdown</strong></p>
<p>Messy code slows everyone down. Moving too fast at the beginning can slow the team down drastically to the point that every change made to the code breaks two or three other parts of the code. No change trivial. Productivity continues to fall over the project scope. It is best to slowdown in the beginning and write clean code. 
</p>

<p><strong>The Redesign Rebellion</strong></p>
<p>The easiest out for programmers is to blame those before them and demand a redesign. The tension and battle this creates with management can get nasty. It will also polarize developers as the best developers (the ones that write the best clean code) and the worst. The best will go on to work on the new version of the application, and the rest will continue managing the current crappy code. Spending time keeping your code clean is not just cost effective; it’s a matter of professional survival.
</p>

<p><strong>Attitude</strong></p>
<p>Once the code base is so messy and hard to navigate, programmers often complain. They complain about everything. Complaints about how the requirements have changed from the original design, about tight schedules, about stupid managers, intolerant customers, marketing and sales making false promises, but the truth comes is that we, the programmers, are the unprofessional ones. All these stakeholders look at us to identify the promises and commitments they make. We should not be shy to tell them about the challenges. Why? The end users look to us to validate the way the requirements will fit into the system. Scared of being fired? Most manager want the truth, even when they act like they don’t. It is your job to defend the code. It is too unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will manager who don’t understand the risks of making messes. 
</p>

<p><strong>Code-sense</strong></p>
<p>Eventually professional programmers will grow a “code-sense” which is the ability of looking at messy code and see options and variations. This will help you choose the best variates and provide guidance on the next sequence of transformations. Some call this the art of clean code, taking a blank screen transforming it into an elegant coded system.</p>

<p><strong>Activity</strong></p>
<p>Pair up with your buddy. Share your code repositories. Without making any edits, read through each other’s code, pay attention how you are responding to the code. Did you wade? Looking for some hope of understanding something? Was it straight forward? Did you find yourself thinking about ways to make variations and ways to refactor? By reading the code, do you feel like you understood the requirements of the application?</p>
