<li>YELLING - Avoid typing in all capital letters. Not only does this make messages difficult to read, it also implies that you are yelling.</li>
<li>Assumptions - Always assume that your fellow students have good intentions in their posts and/or replies. If necessary, seek further clarification of the intent or meaning of a post.</li>

<li>Concise - When possible, try to keep messages and posts concise and on topic and posted in the appropriate section/channel.</li>
