	<h1>Required Pre-work for Professional Development</h1>
	
        <h3>Few Things you need to do before the bootcamp starts</h3>
<p>I suggest you do these in this order.</p>
<ol>
        <li>Make sure you have your CNM ID number and schedule a intake meeting with your Academic Coach (Karen) to get your books. As noted in the pre-work instructions, apply as a CNM Visitor Student even if you already have a CNM student ID number and username. This resets the clock on how long your account will be active. If this is your first time applying to CNM, you'll get an email with your credentials. If you were already a student, you won't get an email, your credentials will just be reactivated.</li>
        <li>Schedule a resume review appointment with <a href="https://www.cnm.edu/student-resources/connect-services/job-connection" target="_blank">CNM Job Connection Services</a> on main campus. If you don't already have a resume, fill out <a href="./resumes/Resume%20Worksheet.docx">this resume template</a> and take it over to the career coach at your resume review. Job Connection Services records your visit with your CNM ID number. It is important when you are scheduling that to let the career coach know that you are preparing for entry into the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp.</li>
        <li>Setup a basic LinkedIn account (make sure you fill out your career details) and connect with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielheron/" target="_blank">Dan Heron's Profile</a></li>
        <li>Fill out <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/H7VDPJW" target="_blank">this pre-bootcamp survey</a> with details about your former career</li>

        </ol>
        
        <p>These are all due before your bootcamp orientation day.</p>
