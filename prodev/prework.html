	<h1>Required Pre-work for Professional Development</h1>
	
        <h3>Few Things you need to do before the bootcamp starts</h3>
<p>I suggest you do these in this order.</p>
<ol>
        <li>Make sure you have your CNM ID and schedule a intake meeting with your Academic Coach (Karen) to get your books.</li>
        <li>Schedule a resume review appointment with <a href="https://www.cnm.edu/student-resources/connect-services/job-connection" target="_blank">CNM Job Connection Services</a> on main campus. If you don't already have a resume, fill out <a href="./resumes/Resume%20Worksheet.docx">this resume template</a> and take it over to the career coach at your resume review. Job Connection Services records your visit with your CNM ID number. It is important when you are scheduling that to let the career coach know that you are preparing for entry into the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp.</li>
        <li>Setup a basic LinkedIn account (make sure you fill out your career details) and connect with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielheron/" target="_blank">Dan Heron's Profile</a></li>
        <li>Fill out <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/H7VDPJW" target="_blank">this pre-bootcamp survey</a> with details about your former career</li>

        </ol>
        
        <p>These are all due before your bootcamp orientation day.</p>
