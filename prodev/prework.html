	<h1>Required Pre-work for Professional Development</h1>
	
        <h3>5 Things</h3>
<p>I suggest you do these in this order.</p>
<ol>
        <li>Get your CNM ID and schedule a intake meeting with your Academic Coach (Karen).</li>
        <li>Get your resume ready and setup a meeting to review it with <a href="https://www.cnm.edu/student-resources/connect-services/job-connection" target="_blank">CNM Career Services</a>. If you don't already have a resume, fill out <a href="./resumes/Resume%20Worksheet.docx">this resume template</a> and take it over to a career coach to be reviewed. They record this visit with your CNM ID number and it is important when you are scheduling that to let the career coach know that you are preparing for entry into the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp.</li>
        <li>Setup a LinkedIn Account (fill out your career details) and connect with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielheron/" target="_blank">Dan Heron's Profile</a></li>
        <li>Fill out <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/H7VDPJW" target="_blank">this pre-bootcamp survey</a> with details about your former career</li>

        </ol>
