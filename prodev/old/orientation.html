<h1>Professional Development Orientation</h1>
<h2>What is your plan for Career Actualization?</h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The majority of your bootcamp will be devoted to working on "hard" skills such as learning how to code, version control, and managing deployments. The professional and personal development portion of the bootcamp will be quite different. It will be a deep dive into building confidence and understanding on who you are as a software developer. This will be a little different than traditional career counseling. You will identify what your goals are as a developer and how you are going to achieve them. In the local tech industry, "soft" or "people" skills are highly valued, employers are hiring for "aptitude and attitude" more so than raw technical capacity. They are fundamental to your success. They will require a lot of introspection and willingness to get out of your comfort zone for certain activities such as public speaking, networking, and team building. The pace and structure of the professional development process will be very different than the main curriculum used to teach the coding lessons. In this immersive training environment, please remember to be agile, prioritize collaboration, iterate to success, and always take time to reflect on what you are learning from the entire experience.</p>
