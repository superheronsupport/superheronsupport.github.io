<h1>Things to Consider for your Team Project</h1>

<p>It is important to recognize the difference between your personal project (which you own 100% are responsible for) and the team project where you are partially responsible for. Learning to code on your own personal project is a great way to gain technical talent and understanding. Learning who to code together in a team base environment is different process and an even stronger skill to have. Yet, working with others is quite a different process. Facebook, Google, Windows are all massive applications that were built by professional developers working together. </p>
<p>If you are going to “bootstrap” your own startup or join an established team, you will have to learn the work effectively with your peers, managers, and technical leads. The team capstone project for your program is no different. You will be assigned requirements and a general direction from your technical leads on what to build. Although participants may have a say in what ideas (or themes) they want to apply to the project, they are not final decision makers. Just like an developer at a company, they will be assigned worked and given direction from their instructors (technical leads). </p>
<p>This process is not that different from the actual tech industry. Where employee share their ideas all the time and build prototypes for the company that they work for. Many developers are given tickets to fix bugs or implement features. It is not always enjoyable working on a technical problem or fixing a problem that you don’t feel responsible for. Remember this experience is by design to help you grow as a professional developer. </p>

<h2>Here is a short list of the do’s and don’ts for your team project:</h2>
<h3>Dos</h3>
<strong>Identify each other strengths</strong>
<p>Work together as a team to identify each other strengths and highlight them. </p>

<strong>Peer Review together</strong>
<p>Do not hesitate to switch up your coding buddy. Pair up, talk out to each other your code and what you are working on, get into a regular practice of peer reviewing each other’s code</p>

<strong>Remember you part of a team</strong>
<p>Unless you have been assigned team captain, you are not the leader of your team. Your technical leads for the program are in charge, any issues that you can’t work out over a coffee consultation, please elevate it to your leads. </p>

<h3>Don’ts</h3>
<strong>Don’t get sick with Founderitis</strong>
<p>Founderitis another name for Founder’s syndrome. It generally happens when an idea originator share an idea and it is selected by the larger group. Then while developing that idea further, the founder of that idea because to become overly protective of it, even to the point of causing contention and disunity.</p>

<strong>Share your ideas but don’t choke hold them</strong>
<p>If you recommended a great idea for a team project and it is selected, know that is now no longer your idea. This is very relevant for the real world. Ideas are cheap and spread quickly. It comes down to quick and professional execution to drive success. </p>
<strong>Build a viable application but try to monetize it</strong>
<p>For those participants that are looking to monetize their capstone application after the bootcamp, just don’t. Remember your code and online repository are all open source, meaning they are open for the public to fork at anytime. It is suggested that you create something similar to what you want monetize so you can use your capstone as learning experience.</p>
