<!-- Forward -->
<p>In order to be professional developer, it is the small things that matter. "Attentiveness to detail is an even more critical foundation of professionalism than is any grand vision" - James O. Coplien </p>
<p>In the 50's the Japanese were the master's produtivty through maintenance rather than mass output. A quality approach called "Total Productive Maintenance" taught the a 5 principles (5S philosophy)</p>
<ol>
	<li>Organization | Sorting (Seiri) - Knowing where things are and how you sorted them</li>
	<li>Tidiness | Systematize (Seiton) - Code should be where you expect it to be</li>
	<li>Cleaning | Shrine (Seiso) - Be sure to clean out things that disrupt peace such as future ideas commented out for a later version</li>
	<li>Standardization (Seiketsu) - Create a coding style with your team and set a practice</li>
	<li>Disclipine (Shutsuke) - Practice it and reflect on your work</li>
</ol>
<p>These principles are not to be seen as a feel good to read and agree with. They are a challenge to you to refactor your code mercilessly, to show your great power in the execution of details, and to be responsible. Remember the old saying "Leave the campground cleaner that you found it"? The same is true for coding. "Clean Code honors the deep roots of wisdom beneath our broader culture, or our culture as it once was, or should be, and can be with attentivesness to detail" </p>

<h3>Style Disthingsuish Excellence from mere competence</h3>

<p>A cornerstone of being a professional developer is to care about the quality of the code. "Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care" You are already have so many dependents and things to keep track of as a coder, the last thing you need is messy code. Do yourself a favor and take the time and write clean code.</p>
