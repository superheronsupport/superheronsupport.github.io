<h1>Participant Expectations</h1>
<p>The professional development portion of the bootcamp is quite different than the main component of learning how to code. Therefore there are additional expectations from your coaches to help you excel in your career.</p>
<ol>
<li>Responsibility is yours to schedule meetings, ask questions, get a job or client</li>

<li>Elevate your questions after you have done initial research and asked a cohort member. </li>

<li>Submission of documents are to be on time via email or direct message on Slack.</li>

<li>Participation in all activities are mandatory. Schedule is tentative to change or cancellation.</li>

<li>Emotional Intelligence is a serious skill. Study yourself/be aware of how statements may be interpreted/understood differently. </li>

<li>Cleanliness is next to godliness. Be sure to keep the space clean and organized.</li>

<li>Train, you are here to train. We are not here to do the work for you. While weâ€™ll do all we can to help you achieve your goals, it is ultimately up to you to learn how to learn and succeed. </li>
</ol>
