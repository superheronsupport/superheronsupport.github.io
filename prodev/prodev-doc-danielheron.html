	<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
	<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
	<p>Hi My name is Dan. I conduct professional development workshops to unite people of different backgrounds. I do this by creating learning enivornments in the workplace. Do you work in education?
	</p>
	<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>

	<!-- Google Yourself -->
	<h3>What I learned on Google?</h3>
<p>I learned on Google that I am a go getter type or person with a lot of food related things associated with my name. Found out that I appear more as a marker than a developer. The Natural Epicurean site has got me down as “Asiago” which is an alias that I no longer use for my professional development.
 </p>
	
<!-- Self-Worth Questions -->
<h3>Self-Worth Questions</h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>What are internal and external factors keeping you from achieving your goal?</strong> - Internal Fear about settling down is preventing me from have the types of relationships I desire. Commitment is scary.</li>
	<li><strong>How do you personally create value for others?</strong> - I create value for others by optimizing their time, their understanding of subject matter while keeping it all organized so they don't have to think much, or rather they can put on the polishing touches.</li>
	<li><strong>Has anyone ever told you that you have potential, professionally speaking? Do you believe it? Why, why not?</strong> - At times I am insecure when people tell me I am good at something. I am learning to accept and embrace the skills identified to me as strengths.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
<br>
<h3>Week 1</h3>
<p> I am really excited about this new cohort. They are very due diligent and focused on developing their professional skills both hard and soft. This cohort I am moving me documents and resources to the cloud. It is a good refresher practice to build a pro dev site.
</p>
<h3>Week 2</h3>
<p>
	Getting into a great rhythm at work. Dance class and daily work out is really helping manage stress levels and creating happiness in my life. We are getting into a better flow of management around the camp. We met with all the students, we really have a good group here. I didn’t much training done on Access, Salesforce or Android but I did cultivate some new relationships and start my mentor/mentee meetings up again. 
 </p>
<h3>Week 3</h3>
<p>Last week went fast. I only had three days to finish all my normal work and then we had two days of off-stie training about HyperLedger. It was wonderful. I got to try my first time at Ubuntu Linux and coding in Ethereum.</p>
<h3>Week 4</h3>
