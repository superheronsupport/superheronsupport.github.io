	<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
	<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
	<p>Hi My name is Dan. I conduct professional development workshops to unite people of different backgrounds. I do this by creating learning enivornments in the workplace. Do you work in education?
	</p>
	<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>

	<!-- Google Yourself -->
	<h3>What I learned on Google?</h3>
<p>I learned on Google that I am a go getter type or person with a lot of food related things associated with my name. Found out that I appear more as a marker than a developer. The Natural Epicurean site has got me down as “Asiago” which is an alias that I no longer use for my professional development.

<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
<br>
<h3>Week 1</h3>
<p> I am really excited about this new cohort. They are very due diligent and focused on developing their professional skills both hard and soft. This cohort I am moving me documents and resources to the cloud. It is a good refresher practice to build a pro dev site.
</p>
<h3>Week 2</h3>
<p>
	Getting into a great rhythm at work. Dance class and daily work out is really helping manage stress levels and creating happiness in my life. We are getting into a better flow of management around the camp. We met with all the students, we really have a good group here. I didn’t much training done on Access, Salesforce or Android but I did cultivate some new relationships and start my mentor/mentee meetings up again. 
 </p>
<h3>Week 3</h3>
