	<h1>Pro Dev Orientation</h1>
	<h2>What is your plan for Career Actualization?</h2>
	<h3>Intro</h3>
	<p>The majority of your bootcamp will be devoted to working on "hard" skills such as learning how to code, version control,
		and managing deployments. The professional and personal development portion of the bootcamp will be quite different. It
		will be a deep dive into building confidence and understanding on who you are as a software developer. This will be a little
		different than traditional career counseling. You will identify what your goals are as a developer and how you are going
		to achieve them. In the local tech industry, "soft" or "people" skills are highly valued, employers are hiring for "aptitude
		and attitude" more so than raw technical capacity. They are fundamental to your success. They will require a lot of introspection
		and willingness to get out of your comfort zone for certain activities such as public speaking, networking, and team building.
		The pace and structure of the professional development process will be very different than the main curriculum used to
		teach the coding lessons. In this immersive training environment, please remember to be agile, prioritize collaboration,
		iterate to success, and always take time to reflect on what you are learning from the entire experience.</p>

	<h2>Types of Professional Development Activities</h2>
	<h3>Core Pro Dev Modules</h3>
	<p>Full-time bootcamps will have core professional development modules that will be conducted during the work week.
	</p>
	<h3>Pro Dev Lab</h3>
	<p>Every Week (generally on Friday afternoons) is pro dev Lab time for all participants of Deep Dive
		Coding. Lab time can range from 1-3 hours depending on the activities that week. Some examples of activities are workshops,
		guest speakers, presentations, pitch practice, team building exercises, employer interviews, "Back to Basic" programming
		and other industry related events. Weekly schedule will be posted in Slack under the #pro-dev-lab channel.</p>
		<h3>Tech Talks (aka Ted Talks)</h3>
		<p>Weekly evening talks from instructors and other senior developers on various technology and programming.</p>
		<h3>Group Workout (aka Recess)</h3>
		<p>Physical exercises and team building activities with your cohort.</p>
	<h3>Community Wide Events</h3>
	<p>In addition to cohort specific activities, there will be occasional fieldtrips for all current Deep Dive Coding participants. 
		They may include a visit to a local employer, business networking event, Demo Day, alumni events, etc. You will be informed
		via Slack about these as they are coming up. </p>
	<h2>Deliverables</h2>
	<p>Participation in all professional development acitivies is crucial to your cohort's success. They make up a portion of your grade and reflect our capacity
		to support you during and after the bootcamp. If you do well in professional development, more than likey you will do well in the tech industry.</p>
	<h4>These are the deliverable items you need to do in order to pass this portion of the bootcamp:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Pro Dev Doc</strong> - This is a document where you write your post your homework and  weekly reflections. It also a great space to upload and link your assets such as social profiles, resumes, etc. Here is an <a href="prodev-document.html">example template</a> for a pro dev doc. Depending on what bootcamp program you are participating in, the pro dev doc might look a little different. For Web Bootcamp, I am looking for a Web Document (HTML, CSS). For the Android bootcamp, I am looking for an App (XML). Regardless of the platform, I am just lookin for just a simple Views and Markup. If you want to something more you are welcome to. Please make it easy to navigate and read.  </li>
		<li>
			<strong>Resume/Portfolio</strong> - You will be required to create an updated tech resume that can be printed up as PDF on one page. You are welcome to make an online resume if you want in additional to the paper version.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Updated Online Presence</strong> - You will need to research yourself and come up with a strategy for your online presence. Having a complete LinkedIn profile is the minimum acceptable product. If you have concerns about putting yourself out there online, please see your coaches right away.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Coding Repository</strong> - You will need an online and open code repository so Employers can see you that actually code. Please link this on your Pro Dev Doc.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Community Engagement</strong> - We will be observing your initiatives to get out in there such as atteding tech events, interacting with potential employers/clients, getting yourself an internship, etc. If we don't see it or hear about it, we might not know about your drive.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Participant Expectations</h2>
	<p>The professional development portion of the bootcamp is quite different than the main component of learning how to code. Therefore there are additional expectations from your coaches to help you excel in your career.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Responsibility is on you to schedule meetings, ask questions, get a job or client</li>
	<li>Elevate your questions after you have done initial research and asked a cohort member aka Who Wants to be a Developer! </li>
	<li>Submission of homework assignments are to be on time via email or direct message on Slack. We will not hunt you down for your these. Donâ€™t expect that we will check you repository to see if you did the work.</li>
	<li>Participation in all activities are mandatory. If you need to opt-out of something, please consult with your manager otherwise you will receive negative marks. Schedule is tentative to change or cancellation. </li>
	<li>Emotional Intelligence is a serious skill. Study yourself/be aware of how statements may be interpreted/understood differently. </li>
	<li>Cleanliness is next to godliness. Be sure to keep the space clean and organized.</li>
	<li>Train, you are here to train. We are not here to do the work for you. While we will do all we can to help you achieve your goals, it is ultimately up to you to learn how to learn. </li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Things to consider to increase your Tech Talent</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Coding "Lite" jobs</li>
	<li>Workplace, not classroom</li>
	<li>People help people get jobs. So, get out there and engage with community</li>
	<li>Sandbox Stuff vs Core-Work</li>
	<li>You are a libility until you are an asset</li>
	</ul>
